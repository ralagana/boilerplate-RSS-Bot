# Boilerplate-RSS-bot


## RSS Bot for Webex

The RSS bot for Webex is a boilerplate parser bot designed to digest the data provided from any compatible RSS Feeds, and update a Webex space of your choosing whenever there is a new feed.

**Note:** No initial messages will be published to the spaces when app is loaded. Only when a message is received on the RSS Feed it will be published into the respective space.

## Prerequisites
1. Register a Bot at [Webex Developers](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps) for your Organization, noting the Token ID
2. Create Spaces for Output Messages in Webex App (or skip to step 3 if you have a space/room already)
3. Obtain RoomId for the space/room
4. Add Bot created in Step 1 to your space.
5. Create a .env file and add the required variables below.

## Deployment (Local)

1. Clone / Download repository
2. Run `npm install` to add the require dependencies (ensure Node and NPM are installed)
3. Create an `.env` file and include the required variables outlined below.
- Recommend adding `CONSOLE_LEVEL=debug` during initial testing
4. Start the integration using `npm run start`
5. Review the console logs to confirm no errors encountered
6. As a suggestion for your Tests, you can use this sample feed https://lorem-rss.herokuapp.com/feed?unit=second&interval=30. It creates a new feed every 30 seconds.

## Deployment (Docker)

The simplest deployment method is using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Clone / Download repository
   - Only docker-compose.yml is needed if using prebuilt docker image
2. Update the included docker-compose.yml file with the correct Environmental parameters
3. - Use the prebuilt image available on Docker Hub (default in docker-compose.yml)
   - Build local image - Uncomment build and comment image line in docker-compose.yml
4. Provision and start the service using `docker-compose up -d`
5. Review the console logs using `docker logs rss-service -f` (assuming you are using the default container name)
